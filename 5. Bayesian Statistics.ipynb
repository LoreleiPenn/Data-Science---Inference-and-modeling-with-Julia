    "- Apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of A given B.\n",
    "- Understand how to use hierarchical models to make better predictions by considering multiple levels of variability.\n",
    "- Compute a posterior probability using an empirical Bayesian approach.\n",
    "- Calculate a 95% credible interval from a posterior probability.\n",

    "Some key points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the urn model, it does not make sense to talk about the probability of $p$ being greater than a certain value because $p$ is a fixed value.\n",
    "- With Bayesian statistics, we assume that $p$ is in fact random, which allows us to calculate probabilities related to $p$.\n",
    "- Hierarchical models describe variability at different levels and incorporate all these levels into a model for estimating $p$."
